I decided against taking prescription medication and after browsing and reading I chose a supplement I wanted to try:  Biotin. I started taking 5000 mcg of Bio,tin daily and within a week saw results. My hair was starting to thicken and fill in nicely. I was even amazed that all these little baby hairs were sprouting along my hairline and bangs. I was literally growing a new hairline back. All these new hairs started sprouting along my hairline and my bangs were thicker which blew my mind. My nails were growing like weeds and were a LOT thicker. Also I noticed my skin was changing for the better. The dry spots on my face were gone and I even developed a glow from my skin. I was beyond satisfied with this product. 
P.S. I have tried Biotin tablets, powder capsules and gel caps and have found the tablets and powder capsules to work the best.

I have had no side effects at all, except -- about a month after adding the supplements, I experienced the worst shed of my life. My hair line receded (even more) and my hair thinned all over my scalp. With some careful teasing, artful arranging of the hair, generous application of Toppik, and lots of hairspray to keep everything in place, I was able to camouflage the shed enough to ride things out.

It has been a life-changer for me. I no longer worry about whether my hair is arranged properly to cover all the balding areas, I no longer worry about going out in the wind or the rain or the sun -- all of which can reveal thinning hair. And, I look so much younger with a full head of hair. It really seems like a miracle, because now I have completely normall,y thick hair after having had badly thinning hair for approximately 45 years! Here is the additional information I wanted to share: (1) As I have continued to use biotin, my hair has continued to thicken and it just never seems to shed any more. (2) I use whatever kind of biotin is available, not necessarily a particular brand name. Lately, I have been buying ""Nature's Bounty"" from Sam's Club. (3) I take one (1) 10,000 mcg gelcap-type dose per day. (4) You must tell your doctor you are taking biotin -- make sure the information is entered on your chart, because the use of biotin can affect the results of your blood tests. I had told my doctor I was taking biotin and it was on my chart, but when I went in for my most recent physical and lab tests, the doctor called back and said my thyroid function looked a little off, which he said might have been due to the biotin, and he had me stay off the biotin for four (4) days and then come back in and take the test again (which was fine). So, do tell your doctor you are taking biotin, and lay off the biotin for several days before you go in for lab tests so you don't have to repeat the test the way I did. Anyway, I do urge you to try this stuff -- it truly is a miracle and has made me feel so much more confident about my appearance!",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

The treatment has been easy to take but overall I could say I saw not real change. I have not underlying conditions, I was simply looking to grow my hair out faster and s,ince I have fine hair I wanted to prevent the hair loss I was experiencing. I should note it is not substantial hair loss. From reading other reviews it seems to work for others with more of a chronic balding type of hair loss or those with other underlying (thyroid issues, Biotin deficiency etc...) conditions, since I didn't fall into either of those, perhaps thats why it didn't work for me.

It worked!  However I started having pretty severe headaches from it.  At first I thought the headaches were related to something at work (the start of a new school year, as I work for the school district).  However, it finally occurred to me after about 2 ½ months of frequent severe headaches and asking myself if I had been doing anything differently or eating anything different to c,ause them, that MAYBE it was the Biotin causing it.      Coincidentally, I had started taking the biotin right about the same time as the start of the school year.  I stopped taking the biotin as soon as it occurred to me that it might be causing the headaches.  My doctor was skeptical that it was the biotin, but thought perhaps it was the ‘delivery system’ (the other ingredients in the pill besides the biotin).  She also suggested it might take a few weeks to get entirely out of my system and she was right.  The headaches did start lessening immediately, though.  After about 4 weeks, I was back to having the occasional sinus headache or tension headache.      Just to do an experiment and to test my doctor’s hypothesis that it might just be the delivery system, after 6 months off the biotin, I tried it again.  I tried a different brand that my friend swore was the answer to her weak, brittle finger nails – and it had 1,000 mcg of biotin in it.  I decided to take only one (when I had originally been taking 3,000 mcg) and SURE ENOUGH, THE NEXT DAY I HAD A SEVERE HEADACHE!  Again, it took a couple of weeks for the frequency of my headaches to go back down to normal even after only one dosage of 1,000 mcg.      It’s funny, I researched biotin on so many different websites before I started taking it and there wasn’t one mention of side effects on any of them!

Stopped it and my mood improved. Restarted it again and mood dysphoria returned. This depression has experienced by a few others based on online comments. Went through some adaptation that really consisted of lower and slower dose increments. Brand and dosage of berberine I believe has to be taken into consideration and taking berberine during my meals, not 30 minutes before them.  One response by a reader addressed that berberine has high levels choline that can impact mood. However, I do believe adaptation is useful and my using berberine has been beneficial to my lipids and metabolic health: 1. A1C down from 6.7 to 5.5; 2. LDL radically down from 130 to 63; 3. Tot Chol from 221 to 132; 4. HDL from 71 to 53; 5. Triglycerides down from 101 to 77.  

I have at the same time engaged in walking 5 days a week gradually building from 4,000 steps to 7300 steps and this has aided the lab changes as well.
  I have increased fish consumption even more and quit taking fish oil because of the new finding of atrial fib risk with fish oil supplements. I have lost weight more easily and kept it off by diet and exercise along with a focus on three other factors addressed below.

Additional Berberine side effects I had: Only one time did I experience GI upset and that was the first day I started berberine and did so at the recommended dosage of 500 mg 2-3 times a day with meals. Way too fast and way to much. Reduced it to 200 mg once a day at my main meal and then increased that to 200 mg two times a day at each of my two meals. Still on that currently.

Now I more experience constipation but in my diet now I have to work to get good fiber as I eat less fruits, starches and bread; After meals I can become cold- this can be assoc. with hypoglycemia I believe from my readings. I am sensitive to medications so believe I just need to keep my berberine doses lower, spread them out, and pay attention to dosing based up my glucose level and symptoms. I also began a pro or pre biotic of sauer kraut that has helped reduce some of my side effects that I hope is improving my gut bacteria or biome health. Also, I tried taking berberine during their meal rather than 30 min before it and this works best for me also.  For those having difficulty I wonder if the quality or BRAND of the berberine being taken needs to be addressed as well as the actual amount. Rule for many new medications; Go low in dose and slowly increase the dose with many medications, even FDA approved medications. 
Note- Berberine has many interactions with many medications that can cause other medications to take longer to be broken down and build up in our body sometimes at too high of levels. I worked hard to check the interaction between it and all the other medications I take such as plavix, beta blocker, statin, etc.

I did join an organization called ConsumerLab.com that reviews various supplements from various companies and have used it to guide me in my choice of brand of Berberine and other supplements. No one is really overseeing these supplements so we have to use resources.  I do not buy anything with artificial ingredients and with sugar in it. 

I am on a quest to replace bad education about my health and diet with good information that is not western medicine or Big Pharma meds and not engineered foods with sugar or corn syrup in almost everything. 

I read and or listen to a podcast or video on U Tube about factors of good health and negative impact of sugar, fructose, trans fats; soft drinks, diet drinks, processed foods, most juices that cause spikes that are literally what causes the insulin spikes and then insulin resistance that occurs in us and leads to DM and heart disease. Instead I eat much fish, good healthy greens and veggies (i.e., such as broc, caul, brus sprts) and EVOO, trying intermittent fasting, beginning step",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1

After 21 days I got my period and usually it takes 33 days to come so I was absolutely surprised. I had moderate acne and now its been cleared for about 90% of it! I even had black heads permanently on my nose and now they're gone. Right now im completing my third month and my hirsutism is starting to get better. Im beginning to have some small spots without hair ,in my thighs. Also, some of my unwanted hair is thinning a little on my chin. I hope my hirsutism will continue to get better with time. I also feel less hungry during the day after taking berberine.

 I think its doing an amazing job so far! I have also lost 1lb per month without doing any major changes on my diet/exercise. I had already been on a diet with the help of a professional nutritionist but I had stopped loosing weight even with a healthy diet and exercise. Im happy Im starting to lose weight again. Right now im in 133lbs and I should be in 122lbs. (Height: 4 11'). When they diagnosed me with PCOS (10yrs ago) I weighted 144lbs and used Metrformin and birth control pills for over 8 years. It did helped me to go down like 10 lbs and with the acne.  I decided to stop all PCOS medications when the pandemic started and tried to go med-free. I went up like 10lbs in a year and a half. Lost 4 lbs with diet and exercise alone and then got stuck. So this past April my nutritionist recommended me this supplement and so far I feel its making the job of the birth pill plus the Metformin combined only in one supplement. 

The cons:
The first month of taking it I got a little tummy ache and bloating that got much better with time. I wouldnt recommend drinking alcohol and taking Berberine right afterwards b/c once I did it after breakfast and mimosas and my tummy got really upset. Also, I wouldnt recommend taking Berberine with coffe b/c of the same reason. Either you take Berberine 1-2hours before or 1-2 hours after coffe / alcoholic beverages and everything will be fine.

I hope my reviews can reach many other girls who have been suffering with PCOS help alleviate their symptoms. Super recommended. The brand I use is Dr Whitaker Berberine 1500mg from GNC.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

Dr. immediately put me on 500mg of Metformin, 2× per day.  At 150lbs.(normal weight is 130lbs.) and 65yrs. young, I immediately began losing weight. By December, I was down to 116lbs., which I hadn't seen since the early 70's.
Metformin took my appetite away and changed the way a lot of foods tasted, which I also think had a lot to do with the weight loss...hell, I was hardly eating!!  Pizza was just one of the many things, I couldn't eat anymore...it just didn't taste good.  And it took a while to get my taste buds back.  Just started eating pizza again about 5-6 mo. ago.  But my A1-c went down to 7.5 and by March 2019 the Metformin was D/C (Dr. was concerned I was losing too much weight).  Was already taking Omega Q Plus with Resveratrol & Turmeric and wanted to try Berberine GlucoGOLD.  Didn't want to take a chance on my blood sugar levels going back up and possibly ending up on insulin.  Had previously talked my Dr. about taking Berberine along with Metformin.  He had read positive results about using Berberine and said I could take them together and agreed I should try it.  And since he hadn't prescribed another medication after taking me off of Metformin, I ordered a bottle and have been taking it almost a year now.  Blood sugar levels have been staying within normal range...last A1-c was 5.9.  AND I started using natural (unrefined) sugar again in September.  But don't use anywhere near as much as I did before being diagnosed.  I think using Splenda and Stevia changed my level of sweetness.  In the beginning of my diagnosis, I was using Stevia but it got to be quite expensive and the taste is VERY different.  It's sweet..but not like sugar and is truly an acquired taste. So I switched to Splenda because it's sweet like sugar!  Started having loose stools, bloating, diarrhea and sometimes cramping stomach aches.  Stopped using it and the issues went away. That was the end of Splenda.  My levels continue to be good even though I'm using sugar.

After two weeks, I developed what I believe is a fungal infection which was worse than the rash. I felt like my skin had been removed and i had immense swelling to my hips and thighs. i gained 7 pounds of fluid and could barely walk. I could only sleep with Benadryl. bc of the holidays and weekend, i couldn't, see my doctor until Monday. I was so desperate and thought it was fungal, I looked for some Lotrimin but couldn't find any in the cabinet. I did find some Colloidal Silver 10ppm that my husband had bought a couple of years ago. When he bought it, I was highly skeptical but I sprayed it on in desperation due to the pain and irritation. I used my forearm as a test site.  In ten minutes my forearm was clearer and I sprayed it again. I walked the dog for 15 minutes and the rash on my forearm was gone. I sprayed it on my shoulders, hips, thighs, and knees with relief in about 30 minutes. Of course, the swelling has not subsided in this immediate period but, I am confident that it will be gone soon enough. I left my chest unsprayed as a test and it continues to be red, swollen, painful, and itching.

The article states: "" How does it work? Colloidal silver can kill certain germs by binding to and destroying proteins."" Then goes on to state there are no know uses for CS.   To have what is considered a reputable medical site mix truth and lies because they prefer to have the government's approval over the health of their readers is disturbing at least and irresponsib,le at best.      I know several uses WebMD.  Here are just  a few examples of how I use nanosilver and the successful results I experience.     I used CS on my cat's facial abscess and it healed in the course of 5 days with no outer intervention, no surgery or drain tubes   Not only did the wound completely heal and the skin grow back but the HAIR grew back as well.  Anyone with pets knows this doesn't happen when surgery and FDA meds are involved.     I have sinus issues from time to time. I use the silver and in 24hours the pain and swelling go down and in 3-5 days I an completely well. Everytime.      I use it on my neighbor's dogs, two labs who get ear infections, and in 12 hours the inflammation is gone.      My point is I know it works.     I'm frustrated to find the ridiculous statements in this article dissuading people who might otherwise be able to form their own opinion as well.  If you aren't allergic to silver, ask your doctors before hand if they have objections to you trying it on something simple: a inflamed cuticle or skin abrasion. I guarantee your doctor will say ""it's not going to hurt you to try"" and then you will see first hand the amazing quality of silver in the biological environment.  My doctor actually uses the silver water I make her.

Don't be misled by hundreds of positive testimonies here depicting CS as a ""wonder antibiotic"".

But I didn't ha ha... foolish me :D   , However, not that I'm saying I regret buying the machine, no, no, it's a good investment I think (mine is SilverLung btw).  All am saying is it is not as miraculous as spammers here would like u to believe.    From my experience, CS is GREAT for mild scald/burn  and cuts (haven't suffered any more severe ones since acquiring the machine (touching wood), so no experience); absolutely great, takes care of the pain in no time --- well, ok, this by itself is quite miraculous :)  Also, quite good for otitis externa, but needs to spray it for several times a day. I have vitiligo patches, which can become hypersensitive to the sun/UV after medication is applied on them, when that happens they become super itchy and disturb sleep --- CS takes care of it well, but might need to re-spray near morning. In short, unexpectedly I find it to be a good pain and itch killer for skin lesions!    But it is NOT effective for treatment or prevention of acne.

She is inoperable due to decades of untreated diabetes. Unfortunately,eight years ago she had a stroke and heart attack that really beat her down. Then ,due to us using sucralose sweetener (spenda) in all her beverages her stomach stopped digesting water. Then her HMO treated her dehydration by messing up her heart medicine ,which blinded her by making her cataracts eighty percent worse in three weeks and giving her a, dose of reglan that blew her brain to pieces.  Thankfully, I found the sucralose problem we stopped using it- it still took two months for her stomach to heal to accept plain water and we had to wait five months for the cataract surgery.  That cataract surgery saved her life. Still most of the heart blood medicines they gave her really effected her brain. This all happened over the last four years. We had some krill oil in the fridge and she was really heading into a bad place so I said lets try this.  The krill oil is simply a miracle. Her brain is coming back to life. Her sores on the front of her legs is getting much smaller. She still suffers greatly but the trend is heading in a positive direction. She takes a very large dose. Three 800 mg in the morning and three 800 mg at night. There is no stomach discomfort and the krill oil is miles more effective then fish oil. She's on lasix for water retention,krill oil which is saving her life and quality of life as well as magnesium picolenate.zinc picolinate,b vitamin supplements and cranberry pills( vitamin c) to fight urinary tract infections.  We are in the fight now. She's also maintains her diabetes will the proper shots too. Buy a quality krill oil and be sure its krill oil.

I think I'm going to cut back on the daily dosage to help this problem, but even if it doesn't, the health benefits greatly outweigh the gas I have (maybe my wife wouldn't agree).",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.  ol  For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme cauti,on and for very short periods.    Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.    To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)    My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.    It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).    Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome.     Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certa,in kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.

(or 1.25mg) of Vitamin D, being prescribed to patients, by doctors! THIS prescribed AMOUNT OF Vitamin D, IS WAY TOO MUCH!   By the way, the majority of doctors have the equivalent of a one half hour course, in nutritional education, IF THAT, included in their schooling.   Food is medicine.   Having said this, I will proceed with my personal experience, and knowledge, about Vit.D.  I take Vit.D because, it is SO IMPORTANT for our overall hea,lth. I am 53 years old, and take a heart medicine, (called Atenolol,) which does not allow me to go out in the Sun. So, I have to take a Vit.D supplement. I take 400 I.U. (or 10mcg) of D3, everyday.   (600 I.U. is the RDA, or the Recommended Daily Allowance, for people over the age of 70.)  Vit.D is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to the normal functioning of our bodies, and plays a large part in keeping us Cancer-free, as well.   Our bodies, continuously, scan through EVERY CELL in our entire body. When this scanning mechanism encounters a cell with a ""bite out of it,"" (due to exposure to radiation, through x-rays, etc.,) or other mutation, it replicates this abnormal cell, and this is one of the ways Cancer occurs.  Vit.D keeps this from happening. That's why it is SO important.   When we have healthy Vit.D levels, the mechanism that scans each and every cell, can recognize the mutated cell, or the cell with ""the bite out of it's DNA,"" that is faulty, and NOT replicate it.  It, instead, discards the cell from our body, and we stay healthy.    15 minutes of DAILY sunshine is, generally, enough for Caucasians to get the amount of needed Vit.D. African Americans, and those with more pigment in their skin, need a few more minutes, (if sunlight is allowed.)  In addition to this, scientists have recently learned that, Vit.D (in larger doses, and over an extended period of time,) is extremely beneficial, in fighting the COVID-19 coronavirus, in it's early stages.   Vit.D is essential for normal growth and development.  It promotes the use of calcium and phosphorus in the formation of our bones and teeth. It is especially needed for infants, children, and women, during pregnancy, and lactation.   In mild cases, results of lack or deficiency of Vit.D, are the interference with utilization of calcium and phosphorus in bone and teeth formation.  Irritability, and weakness are also results of a lack, or deficiency, of Vit.D.  Severe deficiency leads to rickets.  Valuable sources of Vit.D, are Sunlight and Fish-liver oil. Low concentrations are found in egg yolk, cream and butter.  Milk may be enriched with it, (but, 1 quart of whole milk, fortified with V.itamin D, only equals 400 I.U.) Ultraviolet rays from special lamps, acting on the skin, are another way to get Vit.D.  Lesser, or trace, amounts can be found in (fortified) yeast and sea vegetables (Nori, Dulse, etc.)  Natural food sources of Vitamin D are meager.    If one chooses to use Fish Oil, keep it under refrigeration, as that is where it is stable.   We store Vit.D. in our liver.   Again, the Recommended Daily Allowance is 400 I.U. until the age of 70 years old.  Then, the (RDA) Recommended Daily Allowance, goes up to 600 I.U.   I am a Vegetarian.   So, additionally, I take B12, along with my Vit.D, DAILY.   I, also, eat Iron, DAILY, as well, through Natural, Organic, Whole Food Sources, like:  Egg Yolk, Beans, Oatmeal, Raisins, Apricots, Peaches, Prunes, Molasses, Peas, Green Leafy Vegetables, Almonds and Soy Beans.   ~Note:  If you take a Calcium - Magnesium Complex:    Calcium (1,000mg.) - Magnesium (500mg.)  *We can ONLY absorb 600mg. of Calcium, at a time.

Also  none of the prescription or over-the-counter pain  meds I have tried have helped with the bone pain.  I found out that I had become calcium-depleted from heavy-metal pois,oning from a medical implant.

I no longer experience the bone pain at all unless I forget  to take these supplements for a few days. The  muscle pain is much trickier to control but I know  from experience that for me dietary restrictions,  Calcium/Magnesium in equal amounts and Vitamin D  especially when I can't get out in the sunshine are essential in controlling the recurring widespread muscle pain/spasms.

There are 2 types of Vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D2 is created by the body and then gets transformed to Vitamin D3. Thi 50,000 IU of Vitamin D is Vitamin D2. This creates a high level of Vitamin D2 but gets slowly converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is what the body uses and no Doctor would ever give someone 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3. It takes months of a high level of Vitamin D3 intake to create ,toxic levels. So rest assured the 50,000 IU of Vitamin D2 is safe. I am being treated with 50,000 IU because I have had muscle spasm and bone pain for 8 years after I was finally diagnosed with Vitamin D Deficiency (20) I have to take it once a week and have only been doing so for 1 weeek. I did notice some severe muscle twitching, but it was in the areas that I have severe muscle spasm (trigger points). Twitching to me indicates that the D is working because the muscles are reacting to something foreign to them. Also, with any treatment, one should always give the treatment at least a month before discontinuing. We must remember that our bodies are lacking something that it needs and when our bodies get ""used"" to not having this, it will react as if it is a foreign substance and eventually our bodies will get used to the higher amount. I only gave three stars because I have just started the treatement. I will update after the treatment has completed.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0

I called the doc he assured me I must NOT stop taking this since my level of D was so low and that during the treatment it can cause your body to hurt more, as it is affecting your muscles and joints to re adjust back to a normal level and it too rest when you feel sleepy as your body is trying to heal. So I kept taking this, dealing with severe ,pain and resting when I could. Now 1 week from finishing a 12 wk treatment...I have to agree it is working I have had less fibromyalgia pain in the past couple weeks than I have ever had and the sleepiness has declined. When I finish this up I will go on 2000ius per day. So I have to say ... Thank God for the Vit D treatment it just takes more pain and patience to see it through.

Problems included: severe fatigue, muscle pain, severe joint swelling and pain, bone pain, ""foggy"" feeling, sinus problems, ear problems, a positive ANA test result and breathing problems.  I've tried multiple treatments through several doctors and specialists.  Switched to a new doctor and - during intake - found low Vitamin D levels.  Doctor prescribed 100,000 IU's to be taken one time each week for four weeks (to be retested follow,ing).  Initially, I experienced an increase in pain, almost like a tenderness all over my body.  However, the joint swelling, pain, sinus, and several other problems have subsided and the tenderness is getting better.  It wasn't overnight, but I am getting better.    I would highly recommend this treatment.  I know some of the prescribed levels sound scary, but it has helped me to finally experience relief after 10 years of pain...and the level I am taking is short term.  Please stay at it as best you can, I experienced relief from my symptoms and I believe that you can as well, but you'll need to stick with it.    As an aside, my doc says if my numbers check okay at the end of treatment, then I'll move to a 1,000 IU daily supplement.

Both of these symptoms triggered him to check my Vit D which was at 20 and he says low for me s/b 50. He explained the two natural sources are fish/oil and sunshine - neither of which I get a lot of; and the things you would get it from otherwise supplemental is milk, some Oj, etc. I don't use alot either.

FYI to those of you mentioning you live in Sunny areas - doctor told me that dark skinned folks have a harder time absorbing Vit D from sun -which I am. AND you have to actually be out in the Sun in the evening between certain hours to actually obtain the VIT D to a meaningful level.  Anywho if I stick w/ this after talking to him, after 12wks he wants me on 2,000 IUs a day.

The only reason I rated the ""Effectiveness"" section with 2 stars was due to the fact that I haven't completed treatment yet. I haven't noticed any changes with my symptoms, but I'm not sure if my symptoms are due to the D deficiency and I'm only half way through the prescription I was given.  I know many people are hesitant to take 50,000iu (as I was and to be truthful it still gives me pause, every time I take it) and I wanted to share my experience with others who are deficient.     From all the research I have gathered over the last several weeks of reading up on the subject of D deficiency - this is something people shouldn't take lightly.  The medical community have finally realized that D deficiency leads to a whole host of medical problems.  Vitamin D can not only provide treatment for some conditions, but actually prevent others from occurring in the first place.  I couldn't deny the facts and knew I had to take this or possibly deal with greater problems in the future as a result of depriving my body of something it vitally needs.      One other point I wanted to mention for others who might be going through the same experience I am and that's Vitamin D deficiency and an underactive thyroid.  The information on a possible connection  between the two conditions on medical sites have been sketchy - it's alluded to in some writings, but nothing concrete is documented.  Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part that the D deficiency is the cause for the thyroid problem, but only time will tell.  My thyroid is a little underactive, but yet my thyroid antibodies test is negative for hypothyroidism.  So, again, maybe there isn't a link between the two conditions.     I will give another update if anything new happens, if not, I will give a final entry at the end of October when I go for another set of blood tests to see if the D has increased my numbers.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
