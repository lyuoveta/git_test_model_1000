After trying various brands of biotin, I have found that Nutra Harmony Biotin delivers the best results. It has transformed my hair, making it thicker, fuller, and stronger, while reducing breakage. Not only has it accelerated hair growth, but it has also improved the strength of my nails and revitalized my skin. If you're over 35 and seeking effective hair support, I highly recommend Biotin.

Before this, I recently experienced indigestion and back pain, and I've noticed that it's been getting tougher for me to swallow lately, as if something is sort of choking me. I was experiencing headaches and an itchy scalp. Symptoms h,ave improved since I stopped taking biotin. I feel better and none of these adverse effects are present. I'm puzzled as to why there aren't more popular online articles listing more adverse effects in regard to biotin. I had to look a little harder for other individuals who had the same problems I had while using biotin. Prior to consuming biotin, especially in greater doses, do your homework and consider your options."

My hairline was always high but with the thinning it looked to be slowly receeding also. With hair loss being a major problem in my family and also seeing how my two older brothers were slowly losing their hair I began to do a little research. 
I decided against taking prescription medication and after browsing and reading I chose a supplement I wanted to try:  Biotin. I started taking 5000 mcg of Bio,tin daily and within a week saw results. My hair was starting to thicken and fill in nicely. I was even amazed that all these little baby hairs were sprouting along my hairline and bangs. I was literally growing a new hairline back. All these new hairs started sprouting along my hairline and my bangs were thicker which blew my mind. My nails were growing like weeds and were a LOT thicker. Also I noticed my skin was changing for the better. The dry spots on my face were gone and I even developed a glow from my skin. I was beyond satisfied with this product. 
P.S. I have tried Biotin tablets, powder capsules and gel caps and have found the tablets and powder capsules to work the best. Bought the tiny gel cap form last time and even at 10,000 mcg a day they don't work half as good as the other kinds. Just IME"

After taking Wellbutrin for abouta year, I noticed gradual hair loss.  I stopped taking it and felt desperate to regain my thick hair.  I choose to buy Biotin 10,000 to speed up the process; big mistake!!!  Within a few months,  my scalp became itchy.  I sought treatment and help, but no doctor could determined be the cause.  I was told to use dandruff shampoo, which never helped.  A f,ew months later, I began having itchy patches on my body; mainly my elbows, knees, low back, outter thighs and my stomach.  Again, I asked a few doctors for help and was told that I have Ecezma for the first time in my life.  I used the steroid cream without much relief, so began feeling hopeless and depressed.  The itching is so bad that I rarely get a good nights sleep.      Long story short, I threw out all of my vitamins, thinking it had to be an allergic reaction to one of them.  The only one I kept was the biotin 10,000.  As my itching didn’t subside, I finally realized that it must be the biotin.  I did some on-line research and found that doses over 2,500 can cause skin eruptions, itchy rash and scalp!!!!  I have stopped taking it, and the it hi g is slowly becoming less severe.  I am truly hoping that gmo has only get better, as I have been determined to find the cause if my itching.  I have never had this issue before, and pray that I have found the reason.

I have used Rogaine ever since it came out, but it did not thicken my hair much. I began taking Biotin about 6 months ago. For the first 3 months, I felt my hair was thickening, but only slightly. I figured I needed additional help so I began taking some of the supplements listed in the famous Bargello's Vitamin Regimen (Google it). I have taken a multivitamin for many years along with a Vitamin D supplement, so I added MSM, Evening Primrose, and Fla,xseed Oil to my regimen. (No real science to my choice of products; I just went to Natural Grocers and stopped buying after my total reached $40.) I also added Vitamin B-12, based on some online reading. I have not added iron although some sources suggest it might be helpful. I have had no side effects at all, except -- about a month after adding the supplements, I experienced the worst shed of my life. My hair line receded (even more) and my hair thinned all over my scalp. With some careful teasing, artful arranging of the hair, generous application of Toppik, and lots of hairspray to keep everything in place, I was able to camouflage the shed enough to ride things out. It took about a month of misery and self-consciousness, but now my hair is growing in thicker than it has since I was a youngster! My hairline is filling in and there are no thin spots anywhere on my scalp, and the hair that is coming in is not the thin, fragile hair you get after your hair follicles have practically shut down, but robust medium-coarse hair and with no shedding to speak of -- I see only about 5 hairs in the sink after I comb my hair and arrange it, when I used to see at least 20-30. Honestly, it's as if the terrible hair shed I went through earlier was just this great new hair pushing the old stuff out of my follicles! It is SO GREAT having hair again! Try it for yourself!  "

It has been a life-changer for me. I no longer worry about whether my hair is arranged properly to cover all the balding areas, I no longer worry about going out in the wind or the rain or the sun -- all of which can reveal thinning hair. And, I look so much younger with a full head of hair. It really seems like a miracle, because now I have completely normall,y thick hair after having had badly thinning hair for approximately 45 years! Here is the additional information I wanted to share: (1) As I have continued to use biotin, my hair has continued to thicken and it just never seems to shed any more. (2) I use whatever kind of biotin is available, not necessarily a particular brand name. Lately, I have been buying ""Nature's Bounty"" from Sam's Club. (3) I take one (1) 10,000 mcg gelcap-type dose per day. (4) You must tell your doctor you are taking biotin -- make sure the information is entered on your chart, because the use of biotin can affect the results of your blood tests. I had told my doctor I was taking biotin and it was on my chart, but when I went in for my most recent physical and lab tests, the doctor called back and said my thyroid function looked a little off, which he said might have been due to the biotin, and he had me stay off the biotin for four (4) days and then come back in and take the test again (which was fine). So, do tell your doctor you are taking biotin, and lay off the biotin for several days before you go in for lab tests so you don't have to repeat the test the way I did. Anyway, I do urge you to try this stuff -- it truly is a miracle and has made me feel so much more confident about my appearance!"

It's also nice to be able to want to wash my hair again and not feel like I'm accidentally removing all my hair.  My nails are a bit stronger too, althou,gh not a huge improvement, just a slight extra perk.  What I wasn't even aware is I'm borderline diabetic and perhaps this will help with that too.  Oh, I did try to stop taking it (i.e. forgot to repurchase when the bottle ran out) and saw the hair problems come back -- so I won't be stopping this vitamin again.  By the way, I chose Natrol 10,000mcg after doing research (which I see isn't on the list so I had to select their 1000mcg here).  From what I read it's not something you can really overdo.

For me personally it has not. It seems I am having greater hair loss (however after almost  a years worth of growth my hair has grown at a normal rate and is longer than when I started which could be why it appears there is more hair loss). The treatment has been easy to take but overall I could say I saw not real change. I have not underlying conditions, I was simply looking to grow my hair out faster and s,ince I have fine hair I wanted to prevent the hair loss I was experiencing. I should note it is not substantial hair loss. From reading other reviews it seems to work for others with more of a chronic balding type of hair loss or those with other underlying (thyroid issues, Biotin deficiency etc...) conditions, since I didn't fall into either of those, perhaps thats why it didn't work for me. I do hope it works for you if you decide to use it. Good luck!"

I've used Biotin for approximately 3 months now and the results have been remarkable!  Fuller, longer, stronger hair, growing in faster than I've ever experienced.  I'd recommend this to anyone who wants better hair growth."

It worked!  However I started having pretty severe headaches from it.  At first I thought the headaches were related to something at work (the start of a new school year, as I work for the school district).  However, it finally occurred to me after about 2 ½ months of frequent severe headaches and asking myself if I had been doing anything differently or eating anything different to c,ause them, that MAYBE it was the Biotin causing it.      Coincidentally, I had started taking the biotin right about the same time as the start of the school year.  I stopped taking the biotin as soon as it occurred to me that it might be causing the headaches.  My doctor was skeptical that it was the biotin, but thought perhaps it was the ‘delivery system’ (the other ingredients in the pill besides the biotin).  She also suggested it might take a few weeks to get entirely out of my system and she was right.  The headaches did start lessening immediately, though.  After about 4 weeks, I was back to having the occasional sinus headache or tension headache.      Just to do an experiment and to test my doctor’s hypothesis that it might just be the delivery system, after 6 months off the biotin, I tried it again.  I tried a different brand that my friend swore was the answer to her weak, brittle finger nails – and it had 1,000 mcg of biotin in it.  I decided to take only one (when I had originally been taking 3,000 mcg) and SURE ENOUGH, THE NEXT DAY I HAD A SEVERE HEADACHE!  Again, it took a couple of weeks for the frequency of my headaches to go back down to normal even after only one dosage of 1,000 mcg.      It’s funny, I researched biotin on so many different websites before I started taking it and there wasn’t one mention of side effects on any of them!  I hope my experience will help others who might have this same reaction.  "
