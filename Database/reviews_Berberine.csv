Stopped it and my mood improved. Restarted it again and mood dysphoria returned. This depression has experienced by a few others based on online comments. Went through some adaptation that really consisted of lower and slower dose increments. Brand and dosage of berberine I believe has to be taken into consideration and taking berberine during my meals, not 30 minutes before them.  One response by a reader addressed that berberine has high levels choline that can impact mood. However, I do believe adaptation is useful and my using berberine has been beneficial to my lipids and metabolic health: 1. A1C down from 6.7 to 5.5; 2. LDL radically down from 130 to 63; 3. Tot Chol from 221 to 132; 4. HDL from 71 to 53; 5. Triglycerides down from 101 to 77.  

I have at the same time engaged in walking 5 days a week gradually building from 4,000 steps to 7300 steps and this has aided the lab changes as well.
  I have increased fish consumption even more and quit taking fish oil because of the new finding of atrial fib risk with fish oil supplements. I have lost weight more easily and kept it off by diet and exercise along with a focus on three other factors addressed below.

Additional Berberine side effects I had: Only one time did I experience GI upset and that was the first day I started berberine and did so at the recommended dosage of 500 mg 2-3 times a day with meals. Way too fast and way to much. Reduced it to 200 mg once a day at my main meal and then increased that to 200 mg two times a day at each of my two meals. Still on that currently.

Now I more experience constipation but in my diet now I have to work to get good fiber as I eat less fruits, starches and bread; After meals I can become cold- this can be assoc. with hypoglycemia I believe from my readings. I am sensitive to medications so believe I just need to keep my berberine doses lower, spread them out, and pay attention to dosing based up my glucose level and symptoms. I also began a pro or pre biotic of sauer kraut that has helped reduce some of my side effects that I hope is improving my gut bacteria or biome health. Also, I tried taking berberine during their meal rather than 30 min before it and this works best for me also.  For those having difficulty I wonder if the quality or BRAND of the berberine being taken needs to be addressed as well as the actual amount. Rule for many new medications; Go low in dose and slowly increase the dose with many medications, even FDA approved medications. 
Note- Berberine has many interactions with many medications that can cause other medications to take longer to be broken down and build up in our body sometimes at too high of levels. I worked hard to check the interaction between it and all the other medications I take such as plavix, beta blocker, statin, etc.

I did join an organization called ConsumerLab.com that reviews various supplements from various companies and have used it to guide me in my choice of brand of Berberine and other supplements. No one is really overseeing these supplements so we have to use resources.  I do not buy anything with artificial ingredients and with sugar in it. 

I am on a quest to replace bad education about my health and diet with good information that is not western medicine or Big Pharma meds and not engineered foods with sugar or corn syrup in almost everything. 

I read and or listen to a podcast or video on U Tube about factors of good health and negative impact of sugar, fructose, trans fats; soft drinks, diet drinks, processed foods, most juices that cause spikes that are literally what causes the insulin spikes and then insulin resistance that occurs in us and leads to DM and heart disease. Instead I eat much fish, good healthy greens and veggies (i.e., such as broc, caul, brus sprts) and EVOO, trying intermittent fasting, beginning step"

After 21 days I got my period and usually it takes 33 days to come so I was absolutely surprised. I had moderate acne and now its been cleared for about 90% of it! I even had black heads permanently on my nose and now they're gone. Right now im completing my third month and my hirsutism is starting to get better. Im beginning to have some small spots without hair ,in my thighs. Also, some of my unwanted hair is thinning a little on my chin. I hope my hirsutism will continue to get better with time. I also feel less hungry during the day after taking berberine.

 I think its doing an amazing job so far! I have also lost 1lb per month without doing any major changes on my diet/exercise. I had already been on a diet with the help of a professional nutritionist but I had stopped loosing weight even with a healthy diet and exercise. Im happy Im starting to lose weight again. Right now im in 133lbs and I should be in 122lbs. (Height: 4 11'). When they diagnosed me with PCOS (10yrs ago) I weighted 144lbs and used Metrformin and birth control pills for over 8 years. It did helped me to go down like 10 lbs and with the acne.  I decided to stop all PCOS medications when the pandemic started and tried to go med-free. I went up like 10lbs in a year and a half. Lost 4 lbs with diet and exercise alone and then got stuck. So this past April my nutritionist recommended me this supplement and so far I feel its making the job of the birth pill plus the Metformin combined only in one supplement. 

The cons:
The first month of taking it I got a little tummy ache and bloating that got much better with time. I wouldnt recommend drinking alcohol and taking Berberine right afterwards b/c once I did it after breakfast and mimosas and my tummy got really upset. Also, I wouldnt recommend taking Berberine with coffe b/c of the same reason. Either you take Berberine 1-2hours before or 1-2 hours after coffe / alcoholic beverages and everything will be fine.

I hope my reviews can reach many other girls who have been suffering with PCOS help alleviate their symptoms. Super recommended. The brand I use is Dr Whitaker Berberine 1500mg from GNC. "

Dr. immediately put me on 500mg of Metformin, 2× per day.  At 150lbs.(normal weight is 130lbs.) and 65yrs. young, I immediately began losing weight. By December, I was down to 116lbs., which I hadn't seen since the early 70's.
Metformin took my appetite away and changed the way a lot of foods tasted, which I also think had a lot to do with the weight loss...hell, I was hardly eating!!  Pizza was just one of the many things, I couldn't eat anymore...it just didn't taste good.  And it took a while to get my taste buds back.  Just started eating pizza again about 5-6 mo. ago.  But my A1-c went down to 7.5 and by March 2019 the Metformin was D/C (Dr. was concerned I was losing too much weight).  Was already taking Omega Q Plus with Resveratrol & Turmeric and wanted to try Berberine GlucoGOLD.  Didn't want to take a chance on my blood sugar levels going back up and possibly ending up on insulin.  Had previously talked my Dr. about taking Berberine along with Metformin.  He had read positive results about using Berberine and said I could take them together and agreed I should try it.  And since he hadn't prescribed another medication after taking me off of Metformin, I ordered a bottle and have been taking it almost a year now.  Blood sugar levels have been staying within normal range...last A1-c was 5.9.  AND I started using natural (unrefined) sugar again in September.  But don't use anywhere near as much as I did before being diagnosed.  I think using Splenda and Stevia changed my level of sweetness.  In the beginning of my diagnosis, I was using Stevia but it got to be quite expensive and the taste is VERY different.  It's sweet..but not like sugar and is truly an acquired taste. So I switched to Splenda because it's sweet like sugar!  Started having loose stools, bloating, diarrhea and sometimes cramping stomach aches.  Stopped using it and the issues went away. That was the end of Splenda.  My levels continue to be good even though I'm using sugar.  And I believe Berberine is the reason because I'm taking absolutely nothing else for diabetes.

A healthy diet and exercise only got me down to about 230 total. After taking berberine for ~30 days, the value went down about 20%. LDL was also down ~20%. No noticeable side effects.     The goal will be not to take on a continual basis but 30 days on and 30 days off. From everything that I have read, herbal treatments can loose efficacy if taken continually. We'll see how this goes.

Was fine very little if any A fib on my own for few weeks. Doc had recommended Berberine 500mg 2x day months ago but just started it Sunday and last night (Tuesday) 2:30am my heart woke me as was irregular, rapid and as bad as it ever has gotten and lasted through morning which never had happened before. Blood pressure was very low too and felt dizzy as did on med. So glad to see the review on rapid heart rate as makes me think ,it really was Berberine. I have always not done well with meds etc. and get tired when told well no one else gets that through the years only years later to have it listed as side effect.   I say WELL NOW YOU HAVE heard of someone do NOT say that again and be open to it!!!!!!  I will let you know if it turns out NOT to be Berberine."

When my med was increased, it slowed my heart down too much.  I was having serious problems because I could not tolerate most BP meds.  I started taking Berberine, and my blood pressure dropped so low that I had to skip my regular BP med.  (And my heart rate was okay.)  So far I have not noticed any side effects, but a big problem with my BP med was increased appetite, hair loss, and more.  With a little more tweaking of the Berberine ,I should not have to take BP meds anymore.  No more increased appetite, and hopefully my hair will stop thinning!"
