After two weeks, I developed what I believe is a fungal infection which was worse than the rash. I felt like my skin had been removed and i had immense swelling to my hips and thighs. i gained 7 pounds of fluid and could barely walk. I could only sleep with Benadryl. bc of the holidays and weekend, i couldn't, see my doctor until Monday. I was so desperate and thought it was fungal, I looked for some Lotrimin but couldn't find any in the cabinet. I did find some Colloidal Silver 10ppm that my husband had bought a couple of years ago. When he bought it, I was highly skeptical but I sprayed it on in desperation due to the pain and irritation. I used my forearm as a test site.  In ten minutes my forearm was clearer and I sprayed it again. I walked the dog for 15 minutes and the rash on my forearm was gone. I sprayed it on my shoulders, hips, thighs, and knees with relief in about 30 minutes. Of course, the swelling has not subsided in this immediate period but, I am confident that it will be gone soon enough. I left my chest unsprayed as a test and it continues to be red, swollen, painful, and itching. Even though WebMD has poo pooed colloidal silver, my personal experience is that it has saved me from the pain and suffering I experienced after following doctor's orders. And, please know, I don't dislike doctors or have an axe to grind. My father practiced medicine for 50 years and my brother and niece continue the family tradition.

The article states: "" How does it work? Colloidal silver can kill certain germs by binding to and destroying proteins."" Then goes on to state there are no know uses for CS.Â Â  To have what is considered a reputable medical site mix truth and lies because they prefer to have the government's approval over the health of their readers is disturbing at least and irresponsib,le at best.Â      I know several uses WebMD.Â  Here are justÂ  a few examples of how I use nanosilver and the successful results I experience.     I used CS on my cat's facial abscess and it healed in the course of 5 days with no outer intervention, no surgery or drain tubesÂ Â  Not only did the wound completely heal and the skin grow back but the HAIR grew back as well.Â  Anyone with pets knows this doesn't happen when surgery and FDA meds are involved.     I have sinus issues from time to time. I use the silver and in 24hours the pain and swelling go down and in 3-5 days I an completely well. Everytime.Â      I use it on my neighbor's dogs, two labs who get ear infections, and in 12 hours the inflammation is gone.Â      My point is I know it works.     I'm frustrated to find the ridiculous statements in this article dissuading people who might otherwise be able to form their own opinion as well.Â  If you aren't allergic to silver, ask your doctors before hand if they have objections to you trying it on something simple: a inflamed cuticle or skin abrasion. I guarantee your doctor will say ""it's not going to hurt you to try"" and then you will see first hand the amazing quality of silver in the biological environment.Â  My doctor actually uses the silver water I make her.

Don't be misled by hundreds of positive testimonies here depicting CS as a ""wonder antibiotic"". In retrospect I should have been suspicious when I read all the positive reviews here b4 buying my own silver machine, 'cos most of them rated for the ""Ease of Use"" at 5 stars --- but how can it be 5 stars when u have to make it urself with a dedicated machine, each time for hours, let alone all the careful washing beforehand!!!? But I didn't ha ha... foolish me :D   , However, not that I'm saying I regret buying the machine, no, no, it's a good investment I think (mine is SilverLung btw).  All am saying is it is not as miraculous as spammers here would like u to believe.    From my experience, CS is GREAT for mild scald/burn  and cuts (haven't suffered any more severe ones since acquiring the machine (touching wood), so no experience); absolutely great, takes care of the pain in no time --- well, ok, this by itself is quite miraculous :)  Also, quite good for otitis externa, but needs to spray it for several times a day. I have vitiligo patches, which can become hypersensitive to the sun/UV after medication is applied on them, when that happens they become super itchy and disturb sleep --- CS takes care of it well, but might need to re-spray near morning. In short, unexpectedly I find it to be a good pain and itch killer for skin lesions!    But it is NOT effective for treatment or prevention of acne. Okay for folliculitis (infection of hair follicle). I haven't taken it internally so far.  And that's about all I have tried it for so far. Good luck!"
