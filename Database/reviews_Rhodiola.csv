However I got headaches and temple tension on the days I took it and wasn’t able to continue taking it, unfortunately."

Before the stroke I had been in excellent health. My Doc said I was born with a thin artery in my brain that split. I recovered almost fully but for the fatigue that began each morning after being up for 4-5 hours. That fatigue increased minute by minute until it would put me in the bed for an hour nap around 3:00PM. I was having to plan both my business and personal life around this daily exhaustion. I saw se,veral MD's including stroke experts seeking relief but no one had an answer. When traditional medicine had no answer, I searched for a non-traditional answer and heard about rhodiola. I began taking rhodiola compounded by Pure about 5 months ago. I am both surprised and grateful that a ""ROOT"" has given me my life back.

For those problems, rhodiola has been remarkable. It provides an uplifted, buoyant feel and a sense of energy, without the jittery feeling I get when I used to drink caffeine for energy. So, for mood and energy I've found it to be great. HOWEVER, both my husband and I have noticed a notable loss of memory when taking it--can't remember names of people, or, can't put a face with a name when I otherwise would. This change in memory was troubling enough that my husband quit using rhodiola. I try to use it only during the last two weeks of my cycle, when I am most prone to mood problems, and try to put up with the memory problems then.  I do worry, though, about what everyday or longterm use would do to memory.  I hope researchers will look into this rhodiola/memory connection. Maybe one could even learn more about memory illnesses by understanding what the herb does to brain chemistry and how that's connected to memory."

Stoppe,d zoloft and tried exercise plus diet and although I was not as bad, I still had issues. Read about rhodiola root and decided to try it due to the low toxicity. Started with 100 mg/day and within 24 hours I could feel the benefit. I wasn't in a permanently bad mood. After 2-3 days I was slipping back to brief anxiety attacks. Raised it up to 200 mg/day (first thing in the morning before breakfast and 30 minutes before lunch). 3 weeks later and I'm 100% better. I no longer have anxiety attacks even when doing presentations in front of large audiences. This herb has changed my life. I've read hours and hours of different reviews of various herbs and remedies. One thing I've learned is that each body is different and you'll need to try to see what is right for you. For me, this root has helped me. I've been fighting an inner battle of anxiety during public speaking for many years and no longer even have this issue.
