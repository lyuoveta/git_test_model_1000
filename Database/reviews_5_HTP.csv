I was on antidepressants ,but when I csme off all the depressive symptoms came back. 
As soon as started taking it, I started feeling that my depressive thoughts were gone…. Personally I take 200 mg in the morning and 200 mg in the evening. This is what workd for me,however you could be fine with lower dose as well. Dr Janelle Sinclae suggests to take 3x50 mg or 100  also, three times if you feel that is not enough. 
Defenetly it will ease your life and thought.

You must give a chance. At the befinning it gave me some headaches but it went away,as well as a little sleepiness,but now I feel amazing and completely normal again.

Trust me, I am a person who was diagnozed with depression and got hospitalized with anxiet and depression, /psychosis….it was awful

I am hoping that it can help to some of you?? plus taking Rhodiola rosea is also amazing for anxiety attacks."

5-HTP speeds up your brain.  It makes your Calicum absorb easier into your brain cells.  Instead of typical 5-10% of Calicum soaking into your brain cells you can get more like 20% absorbed.  (the rest expelled via urine)

NOTE:  Calcium metabolism in your brain CREATES HEAT.  When I took 100mg twice a day the end result was a feeling that my head was on fire.  I could literally feel the hea,t, and ended up running cold water over my head in the shower- not pleasant!

However, once I started taking it just every other day all of the sudden I can THINK again.  The fog is cleared and all of the sudden my friends are surprised that I'm not lost in a fog.

USAGE WARNING:  Do not take more than recommended and really I would just take half until your brain gets used to it.  If you take with a good multi vitamin- just EVERY OTHER DAY hopefully you will have the good results that I am getting.

I now take with with Citicoline and L-Theanine and find very good mental / memory function, clear head and emotions, and Ashwagandha for sleep.

Overall would recommend- but start with 1/2 dose or you might be soaking your head in cold water!"

No. Matural things existed long before big pharma came along!!

If your doctor gave you 5htp for melatonin, your doctor should be reported, they’re the problem not 5htp. 5htp can increase serotonin. If you take SSRIs or other pharmaceuticals you should ask a pharmacist ,or doctor to look up interactions.

Other ways being diet, sleep, reduction in stress, listening to your heart and doing what truely brings you the deepest joy (not what society/family expects you yo do and not necessarily where the ""job security"" is)   and most importantly - love and resolution of traumas, which are VERY common and are the root cause of most psychological disharmony in our insensitive unaware immature brutal society.   One more th8ng that helped me enormously in coming out of depression and learning to love myself was the writing (and videos) by Jeff Foster and Matt Licata. They are both on facebook and slso have blogs. Deeply insightful and touching and helpful and intelligent and compassionate writings with deep insight into the human condition and suffering. Very highly recommended!   Good luck friends! Please always listen to your heart first and foremost and always love youself! You are precious! "

I have always had difficulty maintaining a normal sleep pattern, ever since my early teens, which is when I first also had the depression that has affected me from time to time ever since.  After having a form of MS some forty years ago (undiagnosed at the time, but a symptom pattern which exactly matches current diagnostic criteria) I now have fibromyalgia which severely affects my sleep,’pattern’ leaving my often unable to sleep for as much as 28 hours at a time., Even then when I do eventually manage to sleep, I may wake again after only 3 or 4 hours before another long period of wakefulness. At other times I may crash out and sleep for 14-16 hours at a stretch. It’s not the pain of fibromyalgia which presents sleep, though that doesn’t help. It’s just that I seem to have a completely muddled sleep ‘pattern’.   I also have very frequent migraines, often daily for periods of up to several weeks. Though, fortunately, the symptoms are largely controlled by preventative treatment and tablets taken at the onset, I find the only way to recover is to sleep,for a few ours, thus further disrupting me sleep.  I therefore take 3 x 50mg capsules of 5HTP each night which has allowed me to cut my prescribed sleeping tablet in half. I can’t say it always works, but it has still made a huge difference. When it does work I can feel it. I gradually become noticeably drowsy and — providing I do nothing to over-ride it like moving around too much or reading/playing Patience (U.S. ‘Solitairr’ I think) on my iPad  for too long and then take my sleeping tablet I usually have no trouble falling asleep.  It sounds very ‘belt-and-braces’ to need both the 5HTP and the prescribed sleeping tablet, but, mostly, without both sleep is very elusive and I’m awake for my usual 26 or so hours again. 5HTP at least gives me some measure of control, allowing me to at least be awake during the day, such natural pattern as I have tending to sleep from 4 or 5am to afternoon."

I started it after my boyfriend died unexpectedly and I fell into a severe depression (normally I suffer from mild depression). I didn’t have insurance, and started researching alternatives to SSRIs. I had taken Zoloft for a spell years ago and it worked for me okay (though I didn’t like the side effects). The day I started taking it it worked! I was able to get out of bed and do the dishes, a major accomplishment at that time in ,my life. Over time and with an increased dosage, my depression and anxiety lifted and my concentration and focus improved. It also helped my sleep, and I didn’t experience a decreased libido like I did on Zoloft.    My advice:    1) Work with your doctor if you want to try this. Do not take 5-HTP with other meds unless instructed by your doctor as this can cause bad interactions (e.g., see #3 -serotonin syndrome).    2) Start with a low dose and work your way up. I started with 50 mg. Over time I upped it by 50 mg increments until I found what worked for me (150 mg once a day).     3) Serotonin Syndrome (where getting too much serotonin is toxic) is real, but from what I have read you have to take 300 mg or more before you see toxic effects. This information may change over time as research teases this out, and I suspect it differs depending on the person.     4) Take an enterically-coated version of 5-HTP. This means it breaks down in the intestine and not the stomach. After a year or so of taking uncoated pills, I started to experience stomach rumbling and discomfort, and a low-grade fever. The enteric pills eliminated this issue.     5) Get a good quality product to ensure you are getting a pure product. I take Solaray.     6) If it makes you sleepy, take it at night. I initially tried it on a Saturday day, when I knew I’d have the day off and could see how it made me feel. It made me drowsy. I now take it ~45 minutes before bed and that’s worked well for me."

This week I started using 5-HTP again, with doses averaging 300-500mg a day. By the very first few days I have already noticed an increased mood, and more positive thinking. I had already begun a change in my mentality before the 5-HTP that was pulling me out of ,my depression but the 5-HTP just catapulted me straight upwards and I feel that it is speeding the process. Somedays I just look around me and am in this feeling of wonder and aliveness. It's like that feeling of life has been handed back to me. It's very meditative. I would recommend this BUT I am worried about heart valve issues if used for a long-term time, so I will be weaning off of this slowly now as I believe I have already gained what I wanted from it. Though I do think the heart valve damage is very unlikely with normal use, as one study I read used HEROIC doses on rats for 3 months, no human being is likely to be using such doses so as long as you make this a short treatment, it is wonderful!"

Effects usually hit 2-4 hours after taking it: general boost in mood, difficult to think negative thoughts, warm fuzzy feeling, sometimes even euphoria. Feelings of love, from loving what you're doing, to feeling better about people around you. Similar feeling to MDMA. I don't know why, it might just be my experience, but the effects seriously last 3 days or so. Then for about 3-4 more days just a genera,l content feeling. After about a week you're back at baseline but I swear that's better than before when I never took any anti-depressants.     BTW, messing with serotonin is dangerous, why I've never sought to get prescribed SSRIs or anything. That's why I only take 1 100mg pill every few days, it only takes a small amount to change the balance of serotonin in your brain. It takes other chemicals in your brain to work....so too much, and you might not even feel the desired effects, just the bad side effects. 100mg/day to me would be crazy. Side effects include a stiff jaw/temples, headaches, stomachache, vomiting, and can last as long it takes for your body to clear all the serotonin. I also don't take it at night as jaw clenching can be bad at night, sometimes even at my low dosage."

My previous experience I used the recommended dose of 100 3x a day and it caused me to have more anxiety and lethargic feelings which I cannot surely say it was from the 5-HTP. However, this time taking it I have found a swe,et spot in dosing and it has kick started a incredibly productive time full of optimism and positivity. I am pretty impressed to say the least. That one little pill a day has caused me to completely turn my mood around into something so positive so that I could go about my day with productivity again. I can also note that my sleep schedule and problems with insomnia have completely dissolved allowing me to have peaceful yet deep slumber every single night. I go to sleep and wake up in the same spot! I wake up feeling ready to start the day instead of wishing I had a few more hours to sleep. A side effect to take into consideration before trying out 5HTP is increased dreaming. It caused my first full blown lucid dream and has made my dreams more lucid and intense. To me it was a good side effect but it may be bothersome for others. Overall, I will continue to take one a day and see how far this goes. "

If you are experiencing anxiety, mind racing, etc after being on 5-htp, this is often the symptoms of serotonin syndrome. It means you do not need that much.  Some of these doses are crazy.  You should also drink green tea eith your 5-htp to protect your arteries (theoretical side effect).  A side BENEFIT of green tea is that it has theanine which will increase other brain chemicals that might be low.  I suffer from moderate to s,evere depression at times, and can only 50 mg for about 3-4 days before I start suffering from anxiety.  Then I'm good for weeks.  Take your 5-htp...not too much...for whatever amt of days. As soon as you start getting s/e's, this is your threshold. Do not take again till the benefits wear off.  You'll have to play around with this.  I suspect some people may be more sensitive due to various reasons. Maybe even methylation problems.  Also remember serotonin ain't the only kid on the block.

It's an important distinction as I can't make a recommendation for its effectiveness for severe depression.  However, for my mood, I was amazed!  It really works!  I am noticeably brighter, less negative, more motivated, able to move about quicker and exercise, and my over-appetite and over-sleeping have gone.  I have never found a non-prescription supplement that had such a real effect -, none of the others have helped.  However, I am still adjusting to it, since I feel a bit ""wired"" after taking it.  In addition, I have felt a bit of a seratonin ""high"", which is great but I have to adjust to my new emotions as that extra self-confidence could spill over into irritability or feeling more confident expressing inner emotions.  It is not as severe as hypomania, but there is definitely a lift in mood that is a shock to the system.  However, I will give it time because I would rather be like this than feeling dull, flabby and sleepy, any day!  I initially tried just 50mg per day, which is the amount per tablet in the supplement I am taking, but I didn't notice any difference.  However I upped it to 200mg after seeing studies on the internet, and this is having the effect."

I have been sleeping through the night and rarely have to get up. My dreams ,are not upsetting anymore and I feel very well in the morning. This very tiny dose works for me and has made a big difference. I tried taking a sleep aid that didn't contain 5-htp to see if it made a difference and after one night I went back to taking the aid with the 5-htp because the 5-htp does make a difference. I hope they don't stop selling this, I have had no bad side effects whatsoever and have been taking it for almost a month."

I had been reading about 5-HTP and seeing the results from comments such as below have been having on peoples lives so decided to try for myself.. what did I have to lose right.. ? My MD had scribed Xanax for me... but it was really causing me to detach from life ,altogether..     I was at Costo last week and found Natrol 5-HTP - although dubious yet excited.. I tried the product and have been taking it for a week..     Well I honestly have to say.. WOW.. what a difference... No more Mr Snapper Head and now I am feeling like ""normal"".. I have no idea how it performs on appetite control as I am a foodie.. but I can say without a doubt that my mood has lifted and I am out of my funk and thats after 1 week.. I have found that the stupid small stuff in life that would occupy my mind for no reason at all has pretty much gone.. I have started to accept things for what they are and move on.. instead of dwelling and festering on things..   So - my opinion - for what it is worth.. go to Costco or the drug store - try it for yourself.. I think you will see a difference.. as so many people like myself have.

The Celexa and Prozac both worked well for about 6 months, and then tapered off.  Increasing the dose had the same effect after a few months.  I weaned myself off the Prozac (with my doctor's approval) durin,g the spring and summer months, and found that with the use of 5 HTP I didn't need to go back on it in the fall for seasonal affective disorder.  At one point I was out of my 5 HTP supplement for about a month, and EVERYONE noticed how much my moods were affected!!!  I felt exhausted, miserable, angry and sad, like having permanent PMS!!!  Within a week of returing to my regular 5 HTP doe, I felt so much better and more in control of my emotions.  I felt normal!!!  This supplement has really been a God-send for me and my loved ones.  It feels great to not be on any antidepressant meds, and to feel good about myself not requiring the medication anymore.  I strongly urge anyone who has depression issues to look into 5 HTP therapy.  It can be used in conjunction with some traditional medications, but you need to check with your doctor.  Please do your research prior to taking any supplement.
