nauseating smell of rotten fish.  I tried 1 whole bottle and tried to take the second, but the gagging was hard to put up with.  I wrote to Native Path about it and they replied that the smell was normal.  I wonder why that is not mentioned in the ads for Krill Oil?  I have never read of that ""side effect"".  I am throwing the unused bottles away as it is just not worth the reaction I have t,o the smell.  Expensive lesson."

She is inoperable due to decades of untreated diabetes. Unfortunately,eight years ago she had a stroke and heart attack that really beat her down. Then ,due to us using sucralose sweetener (spenda) in all her beverages her stomach stopped digesting water. Then her HMO treated her dehydration by messing up her heart medicine ,which blinded her by making her cataracts eighty percent worse in three weeks and giving her a, dose of reglan that blew her brain to pieces.  Thankfully, I found the sucralose problem we stopped using it- it still took two months for her stomach to heal to accept plain water and we had to wait five months for the cataract surgery.  That cataract surgery saved her life. Still most of the heart blood medicines they gave her really effected her brain. This all happened over the last four years. We had some krill oil in the fridge and she was really heading into a bad place so I said lets try this.  The krill oil is simply a miracle. Her brain is coming back to life. Her sores on the front of her legs is getting much smaller. She still suffers greatly but the trend is heading in a positive direction. She takes a very large dose. Three 800 mg in the morning and three 800 mg at night. There is no stomach discomfort and the krill oil is miles more effective then fish oil. She's on lasix for water retention,krill oil which is saving her life and quality of life as well as magnesium picolenate.zinc picolinate,b vitamin supplements and cranberry pills( vitamin c) to fight urinary tract infections.  We are in the fight now. She's also maintains her diabetes will the proper shots too. Buy a quality krill oil and be sure its krill oil. Some of these slimy companies package fish oil in the exact same package.  Good luck to you and thanks to God for the miracle of real krill oil."

I started taking NKO (Neptune Krill Oil) last month to help lower cholesterol.  Within 2 weeks I noticed the pain in my neck from a whip lash injury last year was FINALLY gone.  It has to be the krill oil.  I've done PT, chiropractor, massage therapy and of course rest and have lived with pain everyday.  Now virtually none.  I also was surprised I had NO cramps with my period this month.  Last 2 months cramps were worse than my labor pains.  This month, n,ot even a slight cramp.
