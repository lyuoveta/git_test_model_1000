Methotrexate has liver toxicity as a side effect.  It certainly helps with my auto-immune disease however.  My Rheumy had me start taking 1000 mcg's as soon as I started the Methotrexate. Over the last few years my dosage of the Methotrexate was increased to 1ml weekly and my fol,ic acid dosage has increased to 2000 mcg's daily.

I had 6 miscarriages, 5 of which were consecutive after having had 3 healthy children.  I went to doctor after doctor finally being diagnosed with MTHFR.  After an RE recommended folic acid (which is NOT the same as methylfolate - 2 different forms of vitamin B9), I discovered that made things worse.  I did my own research and discovered methylfolate.  I took this and the ver,y next pregnancy was carried to full term with a healthy baby as a result.  Not only that though - my chronic fatigue, depression, neurological issues, and memory loss all immediately and dramatically improved.    Folic acid is synthetic and cheap - but it is not what the body uses.  It has to convert it to methylfolate first.  For those of us with MTHFR polymorphisms, this process is either partially or completely broken.  Folic acid is not only useless to us, it is actually deadly.
