D level defiicient (28) 30-100 is normal. My oncologist prescribed 50k units of Vit. D2 once a week and 5k-10k Vit. D3 daily. I did my research on Vit. D2&3. Vit. D2 is synthetic. I stopped taking it and upped my daily intake of Vit. D3 to 10k daily. Vit. D is best taken before noon (think sunlight!) and with a meal that includes fat, for absorption as Vit. D is a fat soluble vitamin. It’s also more bioavailable tak,en with Vit. A, B, folic acid and magnesium. At my six month visit Vit. D level was up to 48! Continuing that same course, the next six month check it was up to 58. My oncologist was elated! She said if I keep up this level of Vit. D, I will not have any respiratory issues! "

I was prescribed a 12 week regimen of it and was supposed to return to 2000IU (my original dosage) afterwards pending blood work. I had almost every side effect under the sun (no pun intended). GI upset sans vomiting (thankfully), shakiness, increased insomnia, breakouts around my mouth, then it progressed as weeks went on to scratchy throat, itchy/w,atery eyes, sneezing, and a full blown rash all down my neck. 
Finally after 8 weeks, my doctor took me off of the regimen because both her and another doctor believed that I was actually experiencing an allergic reaction to the high dosage bc I have other issues, including gastric dysmotility that could have been making this already too high dose build up even more in my body and she said I might also be allergic to something the manufacturer uses to produce the pill. I am hoping the 8 weeks I did take of the pills helped bring my levels up, but guess we shall see. I started using it because high dose steroids due to ITP weakened my bones and teeth so much 3 molars cracked and one broke, so they checked my vit D and found the deficiency. "

 8/19/2021 , FloridaGirl |  Age: 45-54 |   On supplement for 10 years or more |   ," Condition: Other , Overall rating 5.0 ,Effectiveness,Ease of Use,Satisfaction,Report this post","First of all, I am extremely alarmed to see 50,000 I.U. (or 1.25mg) of Vitamin D, being prescribed to patients, by doctors! THIS prescribed AMOUNT OF Vitamin D, IS WAY TOO MUCH!   By the way, the majority of doctors have the equivalent of a one half hour course, in nutritional education, IF THAT, included in their schooling.   Food is medicine.   Having said this, I will proceed with my personal experience, and knowledge, about Vit.D.  I take Vit.D because, it is SO IMPORTANT for our overall hea,lth. I am 53 years old, and take a heart medicine, (called Atenolol,) which does not allow me to go out in the Sun. So, I have to take a Vit.D supplement. I take 400 I.U. (or 10mcg) of D3, everyday.   (600 I.U. is the RDA, or the Recommended Daily Allowance, for people over the age of 70.)  Vit.D is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to the normal functioning of our bodies, and plays a large part in keeping us Cancer-free, as well.   Our bodies, continuously, scan through EVERY CELL in our entire body. When this scanning mechanism encounters a cell with a ""bite out of it,"" (due to exposure to radiation, through x-rays, etc.,) or other mutation, it replicates this abnormal cell, and this is one of the ways Cancer occurs.  Vit.D keeps this from happening. That's why it is SO important.   When we have healthy Vit.D levels, the mechanism that scans each and every cell, can recognize the mutated cell, or the cell with ""the bite out of it's DNA,"" that is faulty, and NOT replicate it.  It, instead, discards the cell from our body, and we stay healthy.    15 minutes of DAILY sunshine is, generally, enough for Caucasians to get the amount of needed Vit.D. African Americans, and those with more pigment in their skin, need a few more minutes, (if sunlight is allowed.)  In addition to this, scientists have recently learned that, Vit.D (in larger doses, and over an extended period of time,) is extremely beneficial, in fighting the COVID-19 coronavirus, in it's early stages.   Vit.D is essential for normal growth and development.  It promotes the use of calcium and phosphorus in the formation of our bones and teeth. It is especially needed for infants, children, and women, during pregnancy, and lactation.   In mild cases, results of lack or deficiency of Vit.D, are the interference with utilization of calcium and phosphorus in bone and teeth formation.  Irritability, and weakness are also results of a lack, or deficiency, of Vit.D.  Severe deficiency leads to rickets.  Valuable sources of Vit.D, are Sunlight and Fish-liver oil. Low concentrations are found in egg yolk, cream and butter.  Milk may be enriched with it, (but, 1 quart of whole milk, fortified with V.itamin D, only equals 400 I.U.) Ultraviolet rays from special lamps, acting on the skin, are another way to get Vit.D.  Lesser, or trace, amounts can be found in (fortified) yeast and sea vegetables (Nori, Dulse, etc.)  Natural food sources of Vitamin D are meager.    If one chooses to use Fish Oil, keep it under refrigeration, as that is where it is stable.   We store Vit.D. in our liver.   Again, the Recommended Daily Allowance is 400 I.U. until the age of 70 years old.  Then, the (RDA) Recommended Daily Allowance, goes up to 600 I.U.   I am a Vegetarian.   So, additionally, I take B12, along with my Vit.D, DAILY.   I, also, eat Iron, DAILY, as well, through Natural, Organic, Whole Food Sources, like:  Egg Yolk, Beans, Oatmeal, Raisins, Apricots, Peaches, Prunes, Molasses, Peas, Green Leafy Vegetables, Almonds and Soy Beans.   ~Note:  If you take a Calcium - Magnesium Complex:    Calcium (1,000mg.) - Magnesium (500mg.)  *We can ONLY absorb 600mg. of Calcium, at a time.  So, eat your supplement (of 600mg. Calcium) in the morning, AND at night.  "

I have not found any pharmaceuticals that help much with the systemic inflammatory pain I experience if  I ingest a food or substance (like maltodextrin)  that triggers an inflammatory response.  Also  none of the prescription or over-the-counter pain  meds I have tried have helped with the bone pain.  I found out that I had become calcium-depleted from heavy-metal pois,oning from a medical implant.  The intense bone pain has consistently responded to Calcium Supplementation which I take along with Magnesium and now Vitamin D.  These 3 working together have helped decrease the widespread muscle pain I experience part of every day.

I no longer experience the bone pain at all unless I forget  to take these supplements for a few days. The  muscle pain is much trickier to control but I know  from experience that for me dietary restrictions,  Calcium/Magnesium in equal amounts and Vitamin D  especially when I can't get out in the sunshine are essential in controlling the recurring widespread muscle pain/spasms.  Reading others negative experiences with Vitamin D, I know first hand sensitivity response  reactions to foods, medicines, and additives that  others handle well.

There are 2 types of Vitamin D in the body. Vitamin D2 is created by the body and then gets transformed to Vitamin D3. Thi 50,000 IU of Vitamin D is Vitamin D2. This creates a high level of Vitamin D2 but gets slowly converted to D3. Vitamin D3 is what the body uses and no Doctor would ever give someone 50,000 IU of Vitamin D3. It takes months of a high level of Vitamin D3 intake to create ,toxic levels. So rest assured the 50,000 IU of Vitamin D2 is safe. I am being treated with 50,000 IU because I have had muscle spasm and bone pain for 8 years after I was finally diagnosed with Vitamin D Deficiency (20) I have to take it once a week and have only been doing so for 1 weeek. I did notice some severe muscle twitching, but it was in the areas that I have severe muscle spasm (trigger points). Twitching to me indicates that the D is working because the muscles are reacting to something foreign to them. Also, with any treatment, one should always give the treatment at least a month before discontinuing. We must remember that our bodies are lacking something that it needs and when our bodies get ""used"" to not having this, it will react as if it is a foreign substance and eventually our bodies will get used to the higher amount. I only gave three stars because I have just started the treatement. I will update after the treatment has completed."

I have been afraid to take the extra calcium and Vit D until I am done with the 50,000 mg. It just seems to be a large amount.  I go to an endocrinologist, and she faithfully tests my Vit D levels. When I first wen,t to her she tested my thyroid because I was exhausted all the time and have body pains. My thyroid was l-o-w and am now on a 50 mg pill a day for that. I have hypothyroid (according to others I've talked to, this is not unusual as you get older). Due to this, my doctor started testing my calcium and Vit D. I can remember my mom telling me that I had rickets when I was a baby and would not walk. I do not know what the treatment was at that time, but I do know she took me to the doctor. My doctor was not surprised to hear this news since I have low calcium and Vit D. My energy level increased due to the thyroid treatment. I am hoping when this calcium and Vit D gets to working, my body will be pain free. I have never had any problems taking the high dose of 50,000 mg and faithfully take it once a week until it will be gone (I have great faith in my doctor). Then I will faithfully take the others daily and be retested again. I even double checked with the office girl about this and she called me back and said I was to take the daily supplements in between the 50,000 doses.

Doctor prescribed 100,000 IU's to be taken one time each week for four weeks (to be retested follow,ing).  Initially, I experienced an increase in pain, almost like a tenderness all over my body.  However, the joint swelling, pain, sinus, and several other problems have subsided and the tenderness is getting better.  It wasn't overnight, but I am getting better.

The only reason I rated the ""Effectiveness"" section with 2 stars was due to the fact that I haven't completed treatment yet. I haven't noticed any changes with my symptoms, but I'm not sure if my symptoms are due to the D deficiency and I'm only half way through the prescription I was given.  I know many people are hesitant to take 50,000iu (as I was and to be truthful it still gives me pause, every time I take it) and I wanted to share my experience with others who are deficient.     From all the research I have gathered over the last several weeks of reading up on the subject of D deficiency - this is something people shouldn't take lightly.  The medical community have finally realized that D deficiency leads to a whole host of medical problems.  Vitamin D can not only provide treatment for some conditions, but actually prevent others from occurring in the first place.  I couldn't deny the facts and knew I had to take this or possibly deal with greater problems in the future as a result of depriving my body of something it vitally needs.      One other point I wanted to mention for others who might be going through the same experience I am and that's Vitamin D deficiency and an underactive thyroid.  The information on a possible connection  between the two conditions on medical sites have been sketchy - it's alluded to in some writings, but nothing concrete is documented.  Maybe it's wishful thinking on my part that the D deficiency is the cause for the thyroid problem, but only time will tell.  My thyroid is a little underactive, but yet my thyroid antibodies test is negative for hypothyroidism.  So, again, maybe there isn't a link between the two conditions.     I will give another update if anything new happens, if not, I will give a final entry at the end of October when I go for another set of blood tests to see if the D has increased my numbers."

I think your doctor wants you to either take the 50,000 units weekly or the 400 units, daily.  You don't have to take both.  Start with the prescribed dose. You are usually only prescribed for a short time period.  If it's too much, or you don't feel good on it, cut back to the 400 units daily.  I am increasing my dose to 800 units slowly.  It has a nice side effect of lifting my mood.  Buy a good brand of over the counter D3.  Make sure your get the D3 and the other fo,rms of D are synthetic. Susan"
