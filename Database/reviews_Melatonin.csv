Additionally in some long term users experience withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal syndrome can last many months and is typified by a major depressive episode, agitation, and lack of ability to get to sleep. This is a serious side effect which needs careful monitoring.  ol  For this reason Benzodiazepines need to be used with extreme cauti,on and for very short periods.    Melatonin is effective for sleep disturbances that are not caused by an over active nervous system, such is in the case of Benzodiazepine withdrawal. It appears virtually ineffective during acute (tapered) withdrawal, although somewhat helpful during withdrawal syndrome. For this reason it's main purpose during withdrawal is an adjunct with other therapies.    To my knowledge Melatonin does not effect the calcium channels that have been disturbed by benzodiazepine usage and this is why, in my view, Melatonin is not very effective on it's own as an Anxiolytic (antianxiety agent.)    My experience is that SSRI's are not very effective for use for withdrawal, however responses to SSRI's are individual dependant.    It is essential to manage benzodiazepine withdrawal and protracted withdrawal syndrome using a variety of methods including CBT, but most effectively, using an alternative Anxiolytic, the most effective of which is Phenibut (CALMEXA).    Phenibut Calmexa is GABA with a phenyl ring that allows it to pass the blood brain barrier, therefore replacing the GABA depleted by benzodiazepine dependence. With medical management it can safely and entirely replace the use of Benzodiazepines, causing an alternative dependence both easier to taper with less risk of protracted withdrawal syndrome.     Melatonin used together with Phenibut is very effective for inducing sleep, establishing and maintaining a sleeping pattern.    "

 2/1/2013 , Komp23 |  Age: 25-34 |   On supplement for 1 to 6 months |   ," Condition: Fibromyalgia , Overall rating 4.0 ,Effectiveness,Ease of Use,Satisfaction,Report this post","I am a 32 year old male, 6'5"" and roughly 170 lbs (at my heaviest), diagnosed with fibro 2.5 years ago, infrequent (0-5 cigarettes/day) smoker, very little (1-2 drinks/week) alchohol use, 1-2 cups of coffee per day (never past 5pm); exercises (yoga + strenuous stretching) 6 days/week. Trouble falling and staying asleep. Erratic work schedule. I use melatonin infrequently but with extremely high doses (ie used 20mg last night). Result: vivid dreams, but it helps to keep me asleep. Normally I'll s,leep for 4 hours, then wake, sometimes can't fall asleep again. Chronic fatigue. I'm reviewing just to let people know that this dosage is safe for me (I feel well rested, still tired but not wired, not irritable). The dreams are to be looked out for, like I said extremely vivid especially the first couple times using melatonin.  The diagnose of fibro should convey to readers that I have experienced chronic physiological (specifically muscular and nervous system) arousal for prolonged periods of time (10-15 years) due to environmental and emotional stress & poor cultural/familial support for stress resolution. Worst instance of emotional stress from 9-22 years old. It has not been fun. If you are in a similar circumstance, good luck to you, I know you know how difficult reversing/counteracting this situation can be."

I take 3mg of melatonin approximately mid-day to advance my sleep phase.  The timing needs to be precise in relationship to my internal body clock, which is not always easy to know.  If I wake after an hour of heavy dream sleep, my waking time is a reliable marker and I will take melatonin eight hours later.  If I hit the right timing window, I'll have fairly strong fatigue within an hour.  This lasts for a couple of hours.  I can't do certa,in kinds of work in this state, but I can do housework and listen to lectures.  I call it my stupid pill, but it doesn't actually make me stupid, but impairs my ability to generate outward focus.  Missing my window even once can make it hard to recover the required timing accuracy.  The difference is profound.  I can tell I miss the window because I have far less fatigue.  Taking coffee at the same time as the melatonin significantly reduces fatigue, but it also made the treatment less reliable.  Used to have an ""all nighter"" without fail at least once every three weeks for twenty years.  In my first year on melatonin, I lost control only three times and had to flip over.  Variability in the potency messed me up on one of those.  One vendor didn't work at all.  Another vendor works well most of the time, but some bottles aren't all there.  Think I get mild stomach irritation at night, nothing really to complain about, and it could be other things in the pill.  My life is spectacularly better since I discover this, having found the research myself.  Would love to find a 100% consistent formulation.      "

My doctor suggested that I try Melatonin and it worked wonders. I take one pill a half hour before bed and I have no problems falling asleep. I've been using it for about 2 years and the only side effect I've noticed is that sometimes I have very vivid dreams. Before I started the treatment I rarely remembered my dreams but now often I can in great detail.

Pediatrician recommended it. I was not sleeping through the night. I now am. Have been using it for a week & a half. Since starting, have had red bumps like mosquito bites show up on my stomach, and vivid nightmares. I have had allergic reactions to many other medications, but I love sleeping through the night"

After 3 nights of between 1-3mg I'm noticing dizziness during the day, sinus headaches, and bad dreams. i was trying to go off nortryptiline, but I don't think so now."
