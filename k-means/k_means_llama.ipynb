            "      0.5 - The review is more like negative, as the user mentions that the movie is overrated and has a slow pace, with too much lame slapstick humor that fails to elicit laughter. However, they do mention that it's still a good serious film, which suggests that there are some redeeming qualities. Overall, the review is mixed but leaning towards negative.\n"
