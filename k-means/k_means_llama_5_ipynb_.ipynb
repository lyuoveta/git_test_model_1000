            "     Hi there! I'm happy to assist you with your query. Based on the provided reviews, I would say that the 3rd review is more similar in tone to the 1st review. Both reviews have a positive emotional tone and use words like \"good\" and \"enjoyable.\" Additionally, both reviews mention the acting of the male lead and female lead, indicating that they found their performances solid. The only difference between the two reviews is that the 3rd review mentions the story being a bit long and cliched, while the 1st review does not have this criticism. However, overall, the positive tone of both reviews suggests that they share similarities in emotional tone.\n",
